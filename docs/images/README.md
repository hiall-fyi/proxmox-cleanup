# Screenshots and Images

## installation-success.png

Screenshot showing successful installation of proxmox-cleanup tool.

### What to mask/blur:
- Server hostname/IP addresses (replace with example.com or pve.local)
- Any sensitive paths that might reveal internal infrastructure
- Specific system details that might be sensitive

### What to keep visible:
- The installation progress and success messages
- The "Next steps" instructions
- The clean, professional output format
- All the green checkmarks and completion status
- The helpful guidance for users

## cleanup-results-demo.png

Screenshot showing the cleanup results in action.

### What to mask/blur in the screenshot:
- Server hostnames/IPs (replace with example.com or 192.168.x.x)
- Any sensitive volume names that might reveal internal infrastructure
- Specific container/image names that might be proprietary
- Any authentication tokens or sensitive data in logs

### What to keep visible:
- The cleanup summary (Resources Scanned, Resources Removed, Disk Space Freed, Execution Time)
- The general structure of the output
- The professional logging format
- The success indicators and completion status

### Recommended size:
- Width: 1200-1400px (for good GitHub display)
- Format: PNG (for crisp text)
- Compress to keep file size reasonable (<500KB each)

### Alternative approach:
If you prefer not to use actual screenshots, we can create clean terminal output examples instead.
